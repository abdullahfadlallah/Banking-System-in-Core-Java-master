 # Banking System - Simplifying Financial Management

The **Banking System in Java** is a powerful, user-friendly application developed to simulate banking operations in a simple and intuitive way. It allows users to manage their bank accounts, conduct secure transactions, and view detailed transaction histories. This system is designed to support core banking functionalities such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, viewing account balances, and deleting customer accounts. Built with Java, this application relies on a file-based storage system to persistently save customer and transaction data, offering a lightweight and flexible solution for small-scale banking operations.

The system is tailored for educational purposes, allowing students and developers to understand how a banking system works. It uses the Java Swing framework for the graphical user interface (GUI), making it highly interactive and customizable with various themes. The system ensures basic security measures like data validation to prevent erroneous transactions, while also providing user-friendly features like search functionalities and customizable display options.
